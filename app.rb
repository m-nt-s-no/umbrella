#Here is a suggested outline for your program:
#Ask the user for their location. (Recall gets.)
#Get and store the user’s location.
#Get the user’s latitude and longitude from the Google Maps API.
#Get the weather at the user’s coordinates from the Pirate Weather API.
#Display the current temperature and summary of the weather for the next hour.

#If you get that far, then stretch further:
#For each of the next twelve hours, check if the precipitation probability is greater than 10%.
#If so, print a message saying how many hours from now and what the precipitation probability is.
#If any of the next twelve hours has a precipitation probability greater than 10%, print “You might want to carry an umbrella!”
#If not, print “You probably won’t need an umbrella today.”
